        <span class="line-height"><span class="large bold color">In 1943</span>, the United States Army funded a secret experiment that led to the</span> invention of the world’s first operational computer - the <button aria-controls="#eniac-modal" class="bold letter-space color">ENIAC</button> (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It’s original purpose was to calculate artillery ballistics, and it was an enourmous machine.
      </p>

      <p class="article__p">
        Standing 8 feet high and covering 1800 square feet, the ENIAC was also overwhelmingly intricate: comprised of 5,000,000 soldered joints, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 manual switches and 1,500 relays. The engineers who invented the machine, 
        <button aria-controls="#mauchly-modal" class="bold color"> John Mauchly</button> and <button aria-controls="#eckert-modal" class="bold color">J. Presper Eckert</button>, were now in search of people who could program it.
      </p>

      <p class="article__p">
        During WWII, there were more than 80 female mathematicians working as “computers” for the U.S Army, calculating differential equations and ballistic trajectories by hand. These calculations took a really, <span class="italic">really</span> long time and so the hope was that a team of human "computers" could be hired to perform calculations using the ENIAC. 
      </p>

      <p class="article__p">
        The selected team included <button aria-controls="#bartik-modal" class="bold color">Jean Jennings Bartik</button>, who would later lead the development of computer storage and memory, and <button aria-controls="#holberton-modal" class="bold color">Betty Holberton</button>, who would go on to create the first software application. Together with <button aria-controls="#bilas-modal" class="bold color">Frances Bilas</button>, <button aria-controls="#meltzer-modal" class="bold color">Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer</button>, <button aria-controls="#mcnulty-modal" class="bold color">Kathleen  McNulty</button> and <button aria-controls="#lichterman-modal" class="bold color">Ruth Lichterman</button>, they laid the groundwork for future programmers and software engineers. And, since they were the first modern coders, they were instrumental in teaching others to program after the war.

      <p class="article__p">
        Programming was very different in the forties. In the beginning, the women weren’t even allowed into the ENIAC room because they didn’t yet have the security clearance. Instead, they were expected to code the machine using only paper diagrams of it.
      </p> 

       <p class="article__p">
         These diagrams didn’t come with any instructions - they had to figure it out themselves without any programming languages or manuals, <span class="italic">because none existed</span>. The team had to figure out how to manually program the ENIAC, physically putting the data into the machine using thousands of switches, dozens of cables, and multiple trays.
      </p>

      <p class="article__p">
        The team succeeded in getting the ENIAC to run the requested ballistics trajectory, and on February 15th 1946, the ENIAC was introduced to the world during a public demonstration. During the demonstration, the ENIAC ran the programmed trajectory, and both the public and the press were fascinated.

      <p class="article__p">
        But while the male inventors of the ENIAC received awards and publicity, these women received no recognition for their pioneering efforts. They were never introduced, and when their pictures appeared in the press, the captions didn’t even mention their names or roles. For years, even computing historians regarded them as models - posing in front of the machine to make it look good.
      </p>

      <p class="article__p clear">
        Despite their incredible achievements with the ENIAC, the story of these 6 incredible female “computers” went almost completely ignored by history for roughly half a century. Their stories were virtually lost until the 1980s when a young programmer named <button aria-controls="#kleiman-modal" class="bold color">Kathy Kleiman</button> rediscovered these women and began conducting archival research to put together their stories. She also began to apply for awards on their behalf, finally bringing their achievements into the spotlight and assuring their well-deserved place in computer history.

      The first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. Heralded as a "Giant Brain" by the press, it was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. With a speed one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines, the ENIAC could calculate a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours - allowing one ENIAC to displace 2,400 humans.

After her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer.

      American programmer. After her work on the ENIAC, She helped develop the UNIVAC, designing control panels that put the numeric keypad next to the keyboard and persuading engineers to replace the black exterior with the gray-beige tone that came to be the universal color of computers. She was active in writing the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE). Holberton used a deck of playing cards to develop the decision tree for the binary sort function, and wrote the code to employ a group of ten tape drives to read and write data as needed during the process. Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10 instruction set for BINAC, which is considered to be the prototype of all modern programming languages. In 1997 she received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award, the highest award given by the Association of Women in Computing, and was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame, along with the other original ENIAC programmers.

      American mathematician and programmer. Frances graduated from South Philadelphia High School for Girls in 1938 and joined Temple University. Soon she was awarded a scholarship to Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia. She did a major in mathematics and a minor in physics. During her studies, she met Kathleen McNulty, who was also a mathematics major and they became best friends. Frances began teaching at high schools, while still in college herself, with the intention of becoming a math teacher. However, immediately after graduation in 1942, she and McNulty were hired by the army to work at the Moore School of Engineering as 'computers' and later as programmers on the ENIAC project. When WWII ended, both Spence and Antonelli continued working with the ENIAC, collaborating with other leading mathematicians.

She was hired by the Moore School of Engineering later that year to perform weather calculations, mainly because she knew how to operate an adding machine. In 1943, she was hired to perform calculations for ballistics trajectories. At the time this was accomplished by using manual desktop mechanical calculators. In 1945, she was selected to become one of the first group of ENIAC programmers. Meltzer was an avid volunteer in her community. She delivered Meals on Wheels for more than 10 years, was the treasurer of the Trenton/Lawrenceville chapter of Hadassah and an active member of Women for Greenwood House. During her last four years, she had knitted more than 500 chemotherapy hats for the Susan B. Komen Foundation in Philadelphia.

She took every mathematics course offered, including spherical trigonometry, differential calculus, projective geometry, partial differential equations, and statistics. She graduated with a degree in mathematics in June 1942, one of only a few mathematics majors out of a class of 92 women, and soon after was hired to perform calculations for the U.S Army. During her work programming the ENIAC, Antonelli is credited with the invention of the subroutine. Her colleague, Jean Jennings, recalled when Antonelli proposed the idea to solve the problem where the logical circuits did not have enough capacity to compute some trajectories. The team collaborated on the implementation.

They taught themselves and others certain functions of the ENIAC and helped prepare the ballistics software.
